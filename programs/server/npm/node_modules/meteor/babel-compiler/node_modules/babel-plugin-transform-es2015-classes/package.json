  "readme": "# babel-plugin-transform-es2015-classes\n\n> Compile ES2015 classes to ES5\n\n## Caveats\n\nBuilt-in classes such as `Date`, `Array`, `DOM` etc cannot be properly subclassed\ndue to limitations in ES5 (for the [es2015-classes](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-es2015-classes) plugin).\nYou can try to use [babel-plugin-transform-builtin-extend](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-builtin-extend) based on `Object.setPrototypeOf` and `Reflect.construct`, but it also has some limitations.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-es2015-classes\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)\n\n**.babelrc**\n\n```js\n// without options\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"transform-es2015-classes\"]\n}\n\n// with options\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\"transform-es2015-classes\", {\n      \"loose\": true\n    }]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Via CLI\n\n```sh\nbabel --plugins transform-es2015-classes script.js\n```\n\n### Via Node API\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\"babel-core\").transform(\"code\", {\n  plugins: [\"transform-es2015-classes\"]\n});\n```\n\n## Options `loose`\n\n#### Method enumerability\n\nPlease note that in loose mode class methods **are** enumerable. This is not in line\nwith the spec and you may run into issues.\n\n#### Method assignment\n\nUnder loose mode, methods are defined on the class prototype with simple assignments\ninstead of being defined. This can result in the following not working:\n\n```javascript\nclass Foo {\n  set bar() {\n    throw new Error(\"foo!\");\n  }\n}\n\nclass Bar extends Foo {\n  bar() {\n    // will throw an error when this method is defined\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen `Bar.prototype.foo` is defined it triggers the setter on `Foo`. This is a\ncase that is very unlikely to appear in production code however it's something\nto keep in mind.\n",
